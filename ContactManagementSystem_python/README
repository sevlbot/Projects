-----------------------------Contact Management System--------------------------

 Synopsis:

Contact management system is a software used to manage contact information of people in the userâ€™s contact list. Furthermore, this software is  developed using python version 3 programming language but does not use any of the implemented abstract data types and data structures  within it like lists and sets. Instead, the program makes use of self-implemented generic abstract data types and data structures, namely: hash tables and linked lists.  The software makes use of hash tables to store contacts, quicksort to sort the contact list and linked lists to store filtered data from the table.

The user can interact with the command line interface on the terminal where the menu will be displayed. There the user can perform seven types of operations: displaying contact list, adding contact, deleting contact according to number, updating contact, searching contact(s) with either name or number of contact, sorting contact  list alphabetically according to the names of the contacts and displaying  a filtered list of people from a certain group. The program has been designed in a way that unexpected inputs are handled promptly and notified to the user. Likewise, when operations are completed successfully, the program informs the user.

 Dependencies:

- Python 3: The program is fully built using version 3 of python programming language in a Linux environment

- NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It has been utilized to create arrays and store data in them

- sys: The sys module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. It is used to use command line inputs and outputs for testing purposes

- io: The io module provides Python's main facilities for dealing with various types of I/O. It is used for handling input and output operations in test codes

- unittest: The unittest module provides a testing framework for unit testing Python code. It's essential for writing and executing unit tests to ensure the correctness of the software. It is used to perform all of the tests done during this project


Usage Information

- In order to use this program, you simply need to run the InteractiveMenu.py on the command line

--- python3 InteractiveMenu.py

- Before running the program, make sure you have all of the other python files included
